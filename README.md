# Ben Saufley dot com

This is the source code for my personal website, [bensaufley.com]. It's built
with [Astro] and [SolidJS].

I originally built it in [Preact], but I thought it'd be interesting to try out
Solid. The bummer is, right now, there's very little client-side JS either way.
It's mostly just Astro, rendering during build.
