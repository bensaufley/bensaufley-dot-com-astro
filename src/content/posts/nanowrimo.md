Every November, I say, “This is it – I‘m going to do [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) this year.” And every November … I don’t. I’ve got a long-standing project, begun probably nine years ago, called _Amazing Science_, which I’ve intended to work on during NaNoWriMo for years. And a few years back, I did. But I didn’t get very far – I logged something like 6,000 words that year (the goal is 50,000). Plus, there’s always been the voice in my head telling me that _technically_, NaNoWriMo is supposed to be spent on the first draft, from word zero, of a new novel. So a project like _Amazing Science_ doesn’t really fit the bill.

This year, I’m going to do it. I should say, I’m _doing_ it. This is my declaration that one way or another, high-quality or low, I’m going to get to 50,000 words on a new novel.

The novel is currently untitled, and for file saving purposes, I’m referring to it as _Vuk & Vera_. It’s a fantasy story about two twins in a small fishing town. I would tell you more, but I hope that at the end of the month, or a while after, people will actually read it, so I don’t want to say too much. Also: I don’t _know_ too much more at this point. I’ve got some characters, I’ve got some concepts, and as of this morning, with 1,682 words (thanks [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)!), I’m doing what it appears _those in the biz_ call [“pantsing”](http://www.wikiwrimo.org/wiki/Pantsing).

So, that’s it for now. [Here’s the novel on NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/bensaufley/novels/untitled-vuk-vera/stats), if you’re curious. I’ll probably be procrastinating plenty by griping about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bensaufley), where you can also reach out to me about it if you want.
