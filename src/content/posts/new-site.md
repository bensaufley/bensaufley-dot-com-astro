My previous site was built in Wordpress and hadn't been updated for, really, a number of years. In the meantime I've been hard at work on my career, freelance work, and a bunch of side projects. The first step to updating all that is to get something more workable, so I put together this site. It’ll get spruced up soon, and have its backlog of posts filled out soon from the Wordpress export, but right now it's pretty bare-bones.

If you're here now, take a look at the [contact](/contact) and [résumé](/resume) pages, and check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bensaufley) for projects like [this website](https://github.com/bensaufley/personal-website) and more. Those projects, as well, will get some introduction on this site sometime soon.
