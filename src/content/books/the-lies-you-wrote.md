This was a very satisfying thriller/mystery. I liked the linguistic angle and for the most part I think it was convincing â€“ I'm not a linguist but I do think there are times when one reads a book and the writer's actual lack of expertise is apparent, and I don't think that was the case here. The payoff, the resolution, was certainly spectacular, but it didn't feel unearned or out of left field. I really enjoyed it, start to finish.
