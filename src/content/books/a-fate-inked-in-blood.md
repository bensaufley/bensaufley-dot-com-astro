I didn't realize what I'd gotten myself into when I started this book, but honestly I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the "spicy" parts, which I don't tend to read books for, flowed perfectly well from the non-spicy parts (unlike Iron Flame), and I found the plot engaging, the world interesting, the romance (again, not really my primary motivator to read a book) compelling-enough. The writing is fine, not excellent â€“ a few phrases stick out and start to get annoying, but it's ok. I'll pick up the second at some point.
