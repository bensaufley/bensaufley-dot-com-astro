Better than Dan Brown. A bit of a strange anticlimax though. The last third of the book was a bit of, "is this the big secret? no, is this the big secret? No… is <em>this</em>? …oh, it's over?"<br/><br/>That's probably an exaggeration. But there was at least some of that confusion about what the whole thing was about, as the end approached. Anyway, it's still better than Dan Brown. I enjoyed it. I'd probably read something else by this guy.
