I don't have much to say about this other than that I really enjoyed it. At times Grossman's style of writing and especially the way he discusses magic, its effects, and the various denizens of the magical world reminded me of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, which is (in my eyes) a very positive comparison.

It was a lot of fun to read, but alsoâ€¦ I'm not an expert on books or literature, but it wasn't beach reading. It wasn't a challenge to get through like so much esteemed "literature," but it is all the same very well-written and thought-provoking. I'm pretty excited to pick up The Magician King.
