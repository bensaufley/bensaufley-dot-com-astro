import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

This one was pretty challenging in some ways for me, as a straight, cis man—not because the cis men have become zombies, but because the life experiences I was reading about were vastly different from my own, and in some ways, unfamiliar or new to me and in others, just hard to hear about because I know how real some of that trauma etc is. The characters and the plot were novel and entertaining. I rooted for the protagonists and enjoyed their victories. I also appreciated some of the winks—I think some of the characters traveled through Derry, Maine (? maybe I misheard, listening on audiobook), and <Spoiler>the terfs' warship was named the Galbraith, an obvious nod to JKR's pseudonym which I understand itself is a nod to a historical transphobe of some kind?</Spoiler>

The narrator mispronounced Worcester, which is basically a crime for a book set in New England.
