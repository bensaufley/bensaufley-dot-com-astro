Entertaining and competently written. Hugely formulaic, built on tons of familiar tropes, beginning to end, but well-enough put together. I might listen to more. Early on, the freed slave gives this small out-of-nowhere Ayn Rand rant about the value of struggling to survive that almost made me put down the book. But in the end I didn’t get a ton of that—in fact I got some stuff that was at times quite contrary to it—so I’m happy to have finished it. I might read the next one.
