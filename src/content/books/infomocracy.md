Kind of fun. Felt a lot like Snowcrash early on, but went much more toward politics than tech and action. The characters weren't very fully developed and the whole thing felt kind of light. But I appreciated that so much of the world was insinuated rather than spelled out. If there were a sequel (the plot was fully realized but I could see more here), I'd probably pick it up.
