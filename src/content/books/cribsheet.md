Oster's stance on COVID matters has been disappointing to uncover after making it most of the way through this book; but the book in general is a pretty level-headed and un-opinionated overview of data that I found helpful. I'm not taking anything in it as gospel, but it was at least a good high-level overview of a lot of topics, including some I didn't know I needed to know about.
