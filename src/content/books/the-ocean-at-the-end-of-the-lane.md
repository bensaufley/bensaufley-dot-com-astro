I didn't read all of Coraline (I don't own it - I picked it up at my parents' house and never finished it), but this had a lot of the same feel as the film (which I do own). I like both a lot, and the way he plays with what happens to a child's world when adults aren't on the child's side echoes government conspiracy plots in a unique and more personal way, but I do feel like there were a lot of the same sort of things going on in each book. Ursula felt a lot like the Other Mother. So while I did enjoy it, I just think I might've enjoyed it a bit more if it were a bit more its own thing.

You should definitely read it though if you haven't. It's short and it's worth spending the time on.
