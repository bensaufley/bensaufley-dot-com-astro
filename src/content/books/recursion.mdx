import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

As with most of Crouch's books that I've read: fun, worth reading, nothing particularly mind-blowing. A quick, entertaining experiment with an interesting semi-scientific concept. This felt like the book _The Third Rule of Time Travel_ wanted to be. <Spoiler>I guess I wish the ending hadn't elided the _actual_, final resolution of the issue the book is built around trying to solve. And I think skipping to "we had a romance in another timeline" so that now there's a romance felt kind of cheap; I never really bought into that relationship.</Spoiler>
