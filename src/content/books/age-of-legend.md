Most of these epic fantasy series start to lose me as they get this deep into the series, because the stakes get too broad, and even focusing on the characters, I just lose the sense of who's who (and, to be fair, I definitely mix up names in this one, which is probably made worse by listening to the audiobook) and so I can't identify with the stakes, the storylines, etc. But I really enjoyed this one. The stakes are large but the focus of the story still remains on characters that I connect to and root for.
