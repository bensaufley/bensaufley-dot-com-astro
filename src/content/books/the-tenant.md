Not terribly written, but the structure, the eventual resolution of the mystery, were all underwhelming. Another mystery where I spent much of the book generally enjoying it yet as it wrapped up it kind of felt like a waste. The clues and red herrings put out there were not well-used and certain Chekhov's guns never went off; which I suppose is fine, and maybe even good in a literary novel, but in a mystery, when you reflect on your experience, those things just feel cheap and meaningless.
