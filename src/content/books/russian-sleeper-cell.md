I really enjoyed a lot of this book. The style is fun and smart; the way it kind of meandered into the main plot was interesting rather than insufferable, and somehow the very unavoidable presence of the author's voice (which often takes me out of a book) engaged me and kept me reading. But the _actual plot_ of the book was actually kind of weak/straightforward and strangely concluded (what even was the “sleeper cell” the book is so bluntly named after?). Interesting and enjoyable read that was … I don't know, a little bit of a mess in the end.
