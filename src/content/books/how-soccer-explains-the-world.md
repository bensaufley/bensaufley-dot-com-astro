Decent book. Found that it was more anecdotes about the world surrounding soccer than any sort of explanation of the soccer world, let alone the world as a whole. Interesting stories, though. Mostly compelling - frequently saddening, with all the useless, irrational hate and violence, and not a ton said in favor of a sport the author clearly cherishes.
