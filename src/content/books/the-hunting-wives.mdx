import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

Of all the thrillers driven by "protagonist makes terrible decisions," this is one of the worst offenders. I just don't think enough was done to sell the motivation for this woman to put herself in such terrible situations, _consistently_. I get the suburban ennui, but it really only achieved lip service and we just dive right into "why, why, why are you doing this?" But ok, plenty of thrillers have bad decision-makers; this one _also_ doesn't resolve well. <Spoiler>The whole mystery surrounding Margo's motivations is cast aside when she just … ends up dead. And then the villain does the classic Bond villain monologue to wrap it all up.</Spoiler> It wasn't the worst thriller I've read, but it was deeply frustrating and in the end not very satisfying. Additionally, I know the media is saturated with men dating "barely-legal" teenage girls, but for me that's gross regardless of the gender dynamic.
