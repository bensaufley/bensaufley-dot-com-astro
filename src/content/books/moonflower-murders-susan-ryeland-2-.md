I really enjoy Horowitz's writing, and the Susan Ryeland series especially with its book-inside-a-book conceit. But I'm growing more uncomfortable with his relationship to homosexuality. He made Hawthorne, his meta detective written as nonfiction with Horowitz as the first-person narrator, a homophobe, and literally in his book said "I would not have chosen to write a character like this" but uh, he did. And with Alan Conway, whose sexuality is prominent through two books, we mostly get ugly caricatures as well. <spoiler>The eventual villain of this book turns out to be a former "rent boy," who is apparently <em>not actually gay</em> but performed gay sex for money and is just disdainful of basically everyone around him.</spoiler> It looks like Horowitz once <a href="https://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/journalism/article/anthony-horowitz-on-potentially-ruinous-tv-appearances">played devil's advocate in a TV discussion, against gay marriage</a>, despite purportedly not actually objecting to gay marriage himself. It's not absolutely damning, but also, like, the devil doesn't need an advocate. So it kind of fits this bill, where I don't think he would see himself as homophobic but he's certainly not doing himself or the LGBTQ community any favors.<br/><br/>I feel like I missed an obvious clue (in retrospect) to JKR's transphobia in the early Cormoran Strike books, and I'm worried I'll be doing the same here if I continue reading these. I don't know, though. We'll see I guess.
