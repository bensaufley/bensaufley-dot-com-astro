Very much not the book I was expecting â€“ and that's probably good. I was expecting a kind of techno thriller along the lines of a bunch of other books (did anyone ever read _Format C_? I loved that book when I was a kid ). What it turns out to be is a satire. And it provoked much more thought in that way, I think. The thoughts it addresses are far from new but the way in which they're presented had me defending myself and my own worldview in the context of the implicit criticism.<br/><br/>It's still a bit shallow and oddly paced, but I enjoyed it and I'd probably recommend it.
