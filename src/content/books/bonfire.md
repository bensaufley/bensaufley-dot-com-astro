A pretty well-constructed thriller. Lots of tropes, and I had a few major points figured out long before they were revealed, but not everything, so when it all came together it was still a satisfying conclusionâ€”satisfying in terms of a thriller's construction, of course, not in terms of the kind of dark content.

As an aside, the protagonist felt very much like a character who might be played by the author, to me. I don't think that's a bad thing at all; just interesting.
