I highly, highly recommend this book. Something about the title, presentation, subject matter made me expect it to be a bit less accessible than it was – and I think for some, its "accessibility" will be a knock. It reads like genre fiction, IMO, not literary fiction, but I think that's a point in its favor – stuff like this doesn't have to be dense or intimidating. It's really really smart and comes at the subject matter from what was, in my eyes, a unique way that is both hopeful and not, and I think its main characters represent the kind of "two wolves" inside many of us in the modern world: the impulse to fight tooth and nail and the impulse to try to make a life and carve out some joy are both valid. Loved this book.
