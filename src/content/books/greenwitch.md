I kind of want to give more stars because this isn't really <em>bad</em> but it's really â€¦ it's not a full book. It's one thing that happens, and more than that it's a thing that happens <em>to</em> the children and basically requires no participation. This is a feeling I've had about the series for a while: the mythology and prophecy are really interesting but then the kids just <em>experience</em> it. They just watch great uncle Merry be cool, and they basically don't do anything. They're more passive even than many other kids in a genre full of kids mostly experiencing adventures rather than participating in them. Combine that with the fact that this feels like a short more than a full story, and I can't really give it a particularly good rating. I'm still going to read the next one, though.
