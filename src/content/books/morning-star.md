Really enjoyed this. Resolved the series well. Found that I had grown really attached to the characters by the end.

 <spoiler>two spoiler things:</spoiler> <spoiler></spoiler> <spoiler></spoiler> <spoiler>First, dunno if it was this book or the last, but I wasn't up for the redemption of Tactus the rapist. I did not feel sad when he got his comeuppance.</spoiler> <spoiler></spoiler> <spoiler></spoiler> <spoiler>And second, I feel like the twist near the end here could easily have come off as Deus Ex Machina but I believe it was pretty well-executed. My only gripe is that at no point in the trilogy before that point had we seen such an unreliable narrator. Yes, Sevrus had swooped in a few times without warning, but it seemed like we saw real emotion from the protagonist when he “died,” which is more than withholding information. But still, even with that, I liked it. It was set up well and was a big moment of joy when it was revealed.</spoiler>
