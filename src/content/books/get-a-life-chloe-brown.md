This is the first romance novel I've ever read. It's a charming story and I enjoyed it, with well-written characters and fun dialogue. I liked the way the leads' traumas were handled and how they complimented each other. I didn't need or enjoy the sex scenes, but that's a me thing and it's my understanding that it's kind of part of the genre, so I recognize my issues there are more of a me thing. They were written fine, for what they were.
