Finally finished this. Always found it intriguing but for some reason was never getting any momentum with actually reading it. Switched to audiobook, which reduces some of that friction (usually the friction is that I'm trying to read and my body is trying to go to sleep), and blew through the remaining stuff. Lots of fun. I liked the characters; I liked that the author doesn't particularly talk down to the (presumably YA) reader, even regarding some pretty fun (if mostly bogus) science stuff; I liked the plot. I think there are more, and I'm definitely gonna have to pick up at least the next one.
