Picked up this book at a friend's recommendation years ago but put it down because it seemed grimdark. It isn't! It's not always totally light but it's a lot more intrigue and adventure and heist kind of stuff once you get past the intro. Great fun overall. Did not know where the book was taking me until it was over, but in this case that wasn't a bad thing. It wrapped up (mostly) well.
