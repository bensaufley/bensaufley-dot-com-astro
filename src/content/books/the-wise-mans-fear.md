Enjoyed the hell out of this one, like the last. Ate it right up. That said, a few concerns:

• First, if one more person's mouth makes a line (grim or otherwise) I'm going to lose it.

• Second, Kvothe is what, 17 now? Maybe 18? By the end of the book? Two books in and like two years have passed? It's a trilogy. I'm enjoying this long adventure but I'm wondering what's going to happen to get everything into the third book. It sounds like, maybe, there will be another trilogy after this, that's … maybe AFTER the story is told? I'm alright with that. But I'm still kind of wondering how we get there.

• And yeah, I'm still a little let down by the fact that neither book has had an arc, really. It's all leading to something, hopefully in book three (book six?), which is cool, but I'd like a sub-arc. Something to tie the book together, while the overarching narrative continues on its long, long way.

• There isn't even a _release date_ for book 3 yet? When you've got a story like this that is really one big book in three parts, not three books, you've got to get it out there!
