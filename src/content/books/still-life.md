Honestly I'd rate this book higher if it weren't for the weird side plot with the junior detective. She seems to be on the spectrum, but she's played as this weird, angry “kids these days only care about themselves” character that seems to have no purpose and amounts to nothing other than weird, hateful scorn. I'm probably missing some subtext but it felt very out of place.
