I enjoyed much of this book but the middle third of it falls into this really unsettling indoctrinating justification of genocide. Fantasy often walks a fine line with its many races and the wars between them but this one gets pretty brutal and doesn’t even examine that, basically at all. It’s taken as a given that the actual ethnic cleansing of a race of “tainted” elves from the lands is just and necessary, and it’s gross. It’s even weirder in a book that is otherwise so centered on kind of hippie principles—it even features the line “there’s no such thing as implied consent”, which, great! But that middle section … oof. I’m not sure I want to pick up the final book.
