The writing style and the depth of the characters were about as expected, but I actually really enjoyed the story and its concepts – more than I expected. It was intriguing and didn't have me rolling my eyes nearly as often as I was afraid I might. Maybe I'm giving it four stars because my expectations began so low? Which isn't to say I expected it to be terrible – I expected to enjoy it, but more in the way one enjoys "bad television," or similar media: largely in spite of itself. I expected it to be mindless fun, and while it certainly wasn't high-brow, it was interesting and entertaining from start to finish. I'd read another one of Child's books before I read another Dan Brown (whose books purport to be intellectually compelling).
