The first characters we're introduced to seem like the most obvious and ham-fisted "enemies to lovers" I've ever seen and I wondered what I was in for, but as the book goes on it gets stranger, less predictable, and frankly the writing gets better (and also stranger, at times). I would not have guessed, starting out, that I'd like this book any more than so much "is it YA, or isn't it?" fantasy I've read over the years. But by the end, I really liked it. Will pick up the sequel soon.
