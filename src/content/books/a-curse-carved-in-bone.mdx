import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

This was a fun duology. The scope of this one broadened significantly and I think with a lot of books and movies that take a similar route, I find myself checking out—but I enjoyed all the twists and turns, for the most part, and I never lost sight of the characters at the center, which kept me invested. <Spoiler>The epilogue was silly, though: she admirably swore off war… and then immediately un-swore it off in a scene that felt like the last scene of _The Incredibles_.</Spoiler>
