I really enjoyed this book. I'd been looking, for a while, for the next book that would capture me, make me care about the characters and really look forward to picking it up again – which hadn't happened since I finished Lev Grossman's Magicians trilogy – and this was it.

I don't know if this book is YA. It's hard to tell at a certain point. The vocabulary is good but probably not overly challenging. The subject matter borders on adult? But in a fantasy genre that appears to mark itself as “adult” by competing to show misery and depravity (“historical accuracy”), or at least requires massive tomes with hundreds of characters, a book like this feels out of place. Like Gaiman's Stardust, it's got more of a fairy tale than a strict “fantasy” feel. In the end I'd categorize this as YA-appropriate but probably not a YA book.

Like Leigh Bardugo's Shadow and Bone series, this book opts for a Slavic backdrop rather than the obligatory Anglo-Saxon/Arthurian roots of the vast majority of fantasy, but I thought it was better executed here than in Bardugo's books (her first, at least) – it felt more authentic, for whatever reason. Even though I think largely the names and myths of the book could've been replaced with Anglo equivalents and succeeded nearly as well, the way this universe blended “real” Slavic myths like Baba Jaga into this fictional world, and built the magic and the adventure around those sensibilities (the magic wood, the creatures that inhabited it, the way the songs are sung like traditional folk melodies rather than epic castings) really worked well.

A note: with place names like Rosya, Polna, and Venizia (or something like that) I constantly found myself trying to fit this adventure into real-life Eastern Europe. At the end of the day though, my conclusion was that this world drew inspiration from ours, but was not intended to be one and the same. Maybe I missed it. But if Polna is Poland, what is its capital, Kralia (which seems closest to, say, Kraljevo in Serbia, as far as I can tell)?

Another thing I liked about the book was that while it existed in a kind of fairy-tale world, I was never fully sure what to expect. The adventure wasn't laid out before me when I started the book, and it didn't turn out to do what I did expect. Yet with that said, I rarely felt like the new developments were forced or overt maneuverings of the author – it was just a well-built narrative.

This book wasn't perfect. I felt a bit let down by the climax – by the partial explanation/history that was unveiled, and by the underlying concepts there. Not overly so, but just a little. I had been built up: I wanted to know! To know more, to understand better.

I want to give this 4.5 stars because I have read better books, certainly. But this was so fun, so well-crafted. 4 stars would be too low. So… 5 it is.
