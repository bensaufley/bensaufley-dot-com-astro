I really enjoyed this. I spent a lot of the book trying to figure out where it was going, and what its political motivation is – dystopian futures rarely lack some political motivation. So far, the only messages I can tell are basic, moral, principles, not political ideologies. Which I like. I think there were hints dropped earlier on that in retrospect were intentional red herrings as far as the intent/plot of the book. I was trying to turn it into The Giver, or something along those lines, and trying to determine the moral lessons I should be learning from all of the factions, which ones were good and bad, etc, and while it shared some themes with overt allegories like The Giver and 1984, it's definitely its own thing and a lot more than it initially appears to be.

I also found the love interest plotline seemed to be a much more convincing version of Twilight's. I only read the first Twilight, because it was a garbage book, but it seems to me (as a straight man, obviously not the main target here) that this book did a much better job of a similar thing: the characters are obviously drawn to each other. There's a lot of noticing of clavicles, and tensing of muscles, etc etc, but the characters are a lot more fleshed out and even the attraction feels a lot more convincing. I enjoyed it, and I also enjoyed that (like many other YA/children's series with love stories) it wasn't all about that. It played a part, and did a good job, but it didn't detract from (or attempt to distract from) the larger plot.

I'm really looking forward to picking up the next one.

The ending felt like it didn't live up to what the book had put together – it felt like I, Robot (the movie) or any number of other sci-fi plots, when the book had developed a pretty interesting world and a unique economy and political system. Not only did the whole _mind control_ thing feel like Will Smith battling robots, but the themes were echoed in the lead Erudite doing it all seemingly in the name of logic, and a number of other things. I hate to keep using a Will Smith mis-adaptation of Asimov as an example, especially since I know I've seen this storyline before, but it's all I'm coming up with right now. I'm fine with that plot, mostly - I enjoyed the movie, too, mostly – I just felt like the book set it up for more.

Beyond that, the book seemed to fall apart a little for other reasons here: you have trouble controlling divergents, and you decide the thing to do is send one you're _probably_ controlling to be like the only guy in charge of your quest for Chicago domination? I don't know. I still liked it, and I'm excited to see what happens next, but I do think there was a lot of smarter stuff in the book before Roth had to conclude the first story arc.
