Decent. Nothing I'd take as dogma but listening to it in the context of the story I've been trying to get out forever has I think helped me get over some of the problems I've had with the pace etc of what I've written and sketched out. There's some confusion - three acts overlaid on a four-quarter breakdown is a bit awkward - and the last chapter ("make sure your verb matches with your subject" etc) was hilariously useless. But the points about how to structure the major plot points etc, with a lot of flexibility in what those really _are_, gave me some decent food for thought. Also it's short so it wasn't a huge commitment. We'll see if the effect it's had on my thinking lasts in any noticeable way.
