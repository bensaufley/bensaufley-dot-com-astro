Having listened to Amy Poehler's “Yes Please” and Mindy Kaling's “Why Not Me” before this, I'd say this was my favorite of the three. All good, but this one had some of the sharpest stuff in it. Funny stuff, insightful cultural commentary, interesting stories. Each had these (and that's part of why I group them - the other reason being that they're of course all semi-autobiographical books by modern women of comedy), but I felt like this one brought the most.

It was weird though to hear her talk about 30 Rock like it's still on.

And the chapter about her dad was sweet and interesting but in parts really sounded like she was justifying some, at best, “dated” (more realistically: racist) views. I think she was just sort of explaining how her dad grew up and came to believe what he believed but there were a few things that seemed to dance close to justification rather than just … I don't know, explanation. Don't even know if this paragraph makes sense. I just felt like it got a bit uncomfortable for a minute in that chapter.
