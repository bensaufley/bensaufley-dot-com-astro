Had some kind of fun ideas but the execution wasn't great. The writing style felt amateur; I felt the author's presence too much, both in the language used and sometimes in the concepts (the spell-shooter may be an interesting twist on paper but its description and use were â€¦ I don't know, not compelling). The pacing and arc of the story were offputting, and the protagonist, more even than many others, was entirely along for the ride, making almost no decisions himself.<br/><br/>It wasn't awful, and I imagine some kids will get a kick out of this series. But I think I've been spoiled by other YA that holds up for adult reading.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that you find yourself forced to compare it to Harry Potter - Ben is Harry, Charlie is Ron; but no Hermione to balance out those two personalities! As the book goes, it distinguishes itself from HP, and really that contrast not a fault of the book itself, but you're going to get those comparisons when you write about an orphaned boy who discovers a secret magical world right under the noses of modern-day England. And when the comparisons come, it's no surprise which series wins.
