It was fine. My biggest annoyance is that about half the book is spent running from the obvious truth that the protagonist is misjudging the situation and she absolutely refuses to consider the possibility. That might be a spoiler I guess but it's so, so obvious the whole time. I feel like it's written that way intentionally. But thenâ€¦ it's just annoying.
