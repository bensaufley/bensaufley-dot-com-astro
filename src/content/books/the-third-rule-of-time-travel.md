Coming up with an engaging premise is only part of writing a book, and while it's not easy, it's certainly the easiest part. I thought this book was pretty interesting and asked a lot of interesting questions right up until it became clear that it would hand-wave them all away in the resolution. By that point, a lot of the flaws of the book – the constant, clichéd "in English, please?" between scientists; the cartoonish villain; the less-educated style of speech of a supposedly brilliant protagonist (plausible, sure, but just one more thing) – went from things I'd forgive for an interesting premise to signs that it was never going to wrap up the way I'd hoped. Disappointing, in the end.
