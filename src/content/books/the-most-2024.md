Boy, people like to make fun of fantasy books for their emphasis on world-building but that's basically all that happened here. A simple scenario plays out with endless flashbacks explaining the life stories of everyone involved. Very literary, and certainly not _bad_ but it's funny to think about how this world-building is received in comparison to that of genre novels.
