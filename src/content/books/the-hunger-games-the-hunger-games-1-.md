Even books I'm enjoying don't often pull me in as much as I'd like these days - I find myself setting them down and not picking them up for weeks, even. But I found this in paperback recently and remembered being curious about it when I saw it in hardcover so I bought it. There are so many ways this book could have failed, building on the clich√©s it uses, but it didn't. I found myself engaged constantly, wondering what happened next, worrying about characters, and desperately needing to pick the book up again when I'd put it down.<br/><br/>I don't know. I don't really feel like analyzing it much beyond that, but I really enjoyed it. I'm going to find the second book as soon as I possibly can. And the third just came out! The final book! That's exciting
