Intriguing premise kind of fizzled at the end. Lots of weird over-emphasis of unimportant stuff (the detective's family, the counselor's handsomeness) that led me to believe something would come of it but really just filled space. Without spoiling anything, I'd say I'm kind of fuzzy about how the detective reached the conclusions she reached. I can't tell if some of the details that were revealed as the book progressed were red herrings or things that were supposed to provoke thought, or even imply things that I just didn't end up inferring about the protagonist.
