Pretty far outside my wheelhouse and the "spicy" scenes were prolonged and graphic, which I don't judge it's simply not what I read books for, but the relationship was absolutely charming and as a soccer fan I had a lot of fun with the settingâ€”it's also clear the author is immersed in the woso world for a bunch of reasons, and that added to the authenticity. Very fun read.
