Entertaining. Just about everything I expected from it. My wife and I had the mystery roughly figured out from maybe the midway point, maybe a bit before that, but I can say we were never <em>confident</em> that we were correct, which is just about all you can ask of this type of thing.<br/><br/>We were listening to it on Audible, which has four different voice actors for the four main characters, and we constantly had to pause to sort out which character was which. It was a while into the book before I realized I was confusing two or three of the dudes, and for a while I was forgetting which one had said which earlier on. I think that's justâ€¦ high school drama, right? The names all blend together when you're hearing it secondhand.
