There's some interesting stuff here but it's shoved between hypocritical self-aggrandizement (so much disdain for “businessmen” while simultaneously describing himself as the same thing in different words), weird takes on science (in one breath bragging for creating polyester garments; in the next ranting about the risks of nuclear power and GMOs), and company promotion. Some thoughts about what a business can do to be responsible in the modern world, some thoughts about what humankind can do to stem the tides of climate change … these were good things. But they were delivered in weird patches and at times filled with assertions that made many assumptions I wasn't willing to make.

He has a weird relationship with science. And he says “dirtbag” a lot in a context that I'd never heard before, but I guess that's a thing.
