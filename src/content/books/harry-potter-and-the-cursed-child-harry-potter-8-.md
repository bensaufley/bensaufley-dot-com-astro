I'd be curious to see this live. The medium did it no favors - the writing style is so far from Rowling's that it read more like fanfic than the "real thing."<br/><br/>The story itself is fun and interesting. The pacing is more like a play than a novel so I'll grant it some leeway there.<br/><br/>The dialogue is often quite bad and feels like it was written by someone unfamiliar with the characters he's writing.<br/><br/>Happy to have gotten a little more time in the Potterverse; kind of bummed/underwhelmed in what I ended up getting. Beggars can't be choosers I suppose.
