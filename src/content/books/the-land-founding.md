I was really excited to check this series out. I enjoy the LitRPG genre as I understand it, and I was excited to see that the "founder" of the genre was from an underrepresented group, which I'm trying to make an effort to be mindful of in my reading.

But only about two chapters in this book were particularly interesting or engaging.

The early hours of playing a new RPG are often full of grind. Sometimes, that's nice because it allows the brain to turn off, fall into a familiar pattern, get that dopamine rush from watching your stats rise. But if you were to simply describe this process to another person, even a fan of the genre, it'd be entirely mind-numbing. Sometimes, a good game spices up that process by adding unique lore, uncommon facets to the magic or other systems. Sometimes that can be enough to make the early hours more than a grind. It can add a layer of joyful discovery. But in this book, that wasn't the case. Nothing particularly original seems to exist in this world so far. It's all quite standard. What's worse, the protagonist is supposedly _very familiar_ with the world, from the game. Not everything is apparently like the game, but much of it is. So why spend so much time on piddling exposition? Few interesting characters are met; almost no world building. Much of it is taken up by actual reading of non-metaphorical repetitive dialog boxes and prompts. It's truly like listening to someone describe their first ten hours in WoW. There's not even much of the characteristic "modern Earth inhabitant meets fantasy world" wit of the LitRPG genre, besides like one "FML" reference.

The story of the world and why the protagonist has been brought there is established in the prologue and then never mentioned again.

The book has no thrust, no real climax, and ends suddenly and unexpectedly. We still have neither a short term goal (besides "level up village") nor a long-term goal.

The third act _starts_ to introduce some characters and some conflict but it doesn't do anything with it besides a quick skirmish and I guess a sub-boss?

I dunno. I want to say I'll give book two a chance because it's a popular series and it's possible the author learned a lot from book one, but this one was no fun and I listen while running so it actually meant I skipped my run for a while because I the book didn't motivate me to return to it.
