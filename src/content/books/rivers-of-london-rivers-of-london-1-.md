I would never have read this book if it had been presented in what is apparently the <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/wcX6Y55nNzuQmnWV6">American branding</a> which is renamed "Midnight Riot" and features a low-pixel explosion and a silhouetted figure who looks like Vinnie Jones (the protagonist is mixed race and presents as black) and looks just all-around terrible. But I came across the paperback, with the intriguing map illustration and the "Rivers of London" name, and that made me seek out the audiobook (presented as Midnight Riot by Audible US).<br/><br/>It's a fun story, combining elements of American Gods and other magic stories in a detective/crime structure. I'll probably read the next one at some point. So I'm glad I saw the paperback, and not that terrible American cover, first.
