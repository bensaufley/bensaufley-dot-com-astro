Doesn't feel like a full book â€“ feels like the first book of a book. Not so much of a climax, denouement in this one. Just setting the groundwork for future books. Lots of questions that were set up, I hoped, to be answered, are still unanswered. I think of multi-book plots as still having individual subplots in each book, which this one didn't really. It was just Day One of the story, as I suppose was promised. Which has me a little annoyed and impatient. That said, I enjoyed it cover-to-cover, and I've started the second (which is even longer, at 1000 pages) already. I think, though, if he doesn't give me something to hold onto in this one, I'm not going to get the third (when it comes out? is it out?).
