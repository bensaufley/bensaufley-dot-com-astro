I think this reinforced a lot of my existing feelings about Facebook and Zuck and despite my disdain for hand-wringing about "echo chambers" I do have alarm bells going off off when I notice that type of thing is happening: am I receptive to this info because it's compelling and legitimate or because I want it to be true? I did not go in with any real preconception of Sandberg and her portrayal here was pretty shocking. Started out as a kind of "well I guess it makes sense that a powerful person behaves this way" but it gets worse and weirder as it goes on.

I intend to seek out some more info about some of the stuff in this book, but I will say very little in here seemed on its face to be unlikely to be true given other things I know or have heardâ€”or if not "true" then at least an honest recollection of events.
