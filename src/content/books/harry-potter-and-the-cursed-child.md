<summary>Original Review</summary>
I'd be curious to see this live. The medium did it no favors - the writing style is so far from Rowling's that it read more like fanfic than the "real thing."

The story itself is fun and interesting. The pacing is more like a play than a novel so I'll grant it some leeway there.

The dialogue is often quite bad and feels like it was written by someone unfamiliar with the characters he's writing.

Happy to have gotten a little more time in the Potterverse; kind of bummed/underwhelmed in what I ended up getting. Beggars can't be choosers I suppose.
