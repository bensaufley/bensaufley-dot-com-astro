Picked it up because a movie's coming out and I figured I'd read it before I (potentially) watched it. Having read it, I'll say it looks like the movie won't even be vaguely similar to the book.

Anyway: it was fine. The antagonists were not characters for the most part - more just abstract bad guys. But I did like some of the spookier writing. Not really a genre I care about, but it did give me the creeps a few times. Pretty formulaic; not a ton of world building at all - by which I mean I know next to nothing about the world they lived in. But not bad. Very quick. May pick up a sequel at some point.
