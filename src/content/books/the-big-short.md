I think I only understood about 30% of this book. That's not a criticism of the book, more a caveat of my review. But it was interesting how much time was spent emphasizing how nobody could understand CODs, credit default swaps etc, and then assuming I understood it.

The overarching plot was interesting and I liked the writing style but I kept waiting for it all to click and the Big Short to be laid bare â€¦ and then it was over. I was left with the understanding that yeah, everything they'd bet on had I guess come true and that was bad and also I must be pretty dense to have made it all the way through this book without really understanding some of the key issues.

I'd probably look them up if I were on my kindle but I listened to this on Audible. I should probably go back and fill in the gaps.

Tl;dr - probably a good book that deserved a more informed audience than me.
