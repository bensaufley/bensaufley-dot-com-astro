Another book that gets the "I'm clearly too dumb to fully appreciate this" bump. It took me a long time to get through, even on audio. I set it aside a lot. The writing is very poetic and often abstract, and it jumps between times, places, and perspectives regularly. On audio, at least, some of these jumps are very disorienting and hard to follow. I think it's a very artful book, but I can't say I _enjoyed_ it.
