Surprisingly futuristic for something written in 1909. Its themes have been heard before, time and time again - humankind versus a machine of their own creation, I guess - but 100+ years later the details remain fascinating. I also love the constant talk of "ideas" without any real ideas in sight. "Oh stop this talk, it gives me no ideas."
