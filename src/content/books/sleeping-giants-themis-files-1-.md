It's certainly an intriguing premise. I found myself getting a little bored – I think the interview format can take away some of the interest and excitement from what they're actually talking about. I was pretty sure I'd leave this series after the first – not because it was bad, but just because I have a long list of books to read. But the cliffhanger-ish ending has me unsure whether I'm pissed about the cheap gimmick to get me to pick up the next one, or intrigued enough to do just that.
