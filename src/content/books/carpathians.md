This book purports to be about first contact, but mostly deals with a hyper-capitalist future and how humankind might react to the _possibility_ of first contact. It may be a minor spoiler, but "contact" barely occurs in this book. I did think it was interesting, and for a while I thought the cynical angle of such a hyper-capitalist future added something interesting to the story, but at the end it became clear that that _was_ the story and I was left unsatisfied. If Dixon intends to write a sequel, it would make sense, but I don't see any indication of that at this point. Which leaves a big chunk of the _focus_ of the book more-or-less unresolved.
