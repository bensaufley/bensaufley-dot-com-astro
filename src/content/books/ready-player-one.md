Pretty fun. Listened to most of it on audio. Something about the cover, and the way it had been presented, had led me to believe that this book was as bit more, I don't know, literary? It's not. It's a fun science fiction adventure, and that's about it. The language is plain, the characters are secondary to the adventure. It's a nerd fantasy in the extreme, and sometimes that sort of takes you out of it a bit. But I am still a pretty big nerd. So I mostly enjoyed it, and now I'm moving on with my day.
