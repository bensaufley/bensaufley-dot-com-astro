Very much not the book I was expecting â€“ and that's probably good. I was expecting a kind of techno thriller along the lines of a bunch of other books (did anyone ever read _Format C_? I loved that book when I was a kid ). What it turns out to be is a satire. And it provoked much more thought in that way, I think. The thoughts it addresses are far from new but the way in which they're presented had me defending myself and my own worldview in the context of the implicit criticism.

It's still a bit shallow and oddly paced, but I enjoyed it and I'd probably recommend it.
