Didn't feel like a full story. Felt like a mini-adventure, which I'd assumed was because it was tacked onto an otherwise-complete trilogy â€¦ but the epilogue indicates there's more coming. So this is a mini-adventure _between_ real stories? I'm annoyed, because the tease at the end and the foreshadowing throughout is way more intriguing than this story was. That said, it was fun to pop back into this world, regardless.
