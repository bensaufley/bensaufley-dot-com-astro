A lot more food for thought (no pun intended?) than real prescriptions or proscriptions. Interesting, easily readable. A little more geared to the middle class, further on in life than I am - I essentially still live a college lifestyle still: no dining room, roommates are strangers, little room in the fridge or time to cook it because of social and professional obligations, and definitely nowhere to plant a garden. But that's a lot of excuses and his advice is still sound. It's a lifestyle change and it takes a commitment, as Pollan says. Anyway, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to think about food culture, cooking, even American culture as a whole as it relates to big business.
