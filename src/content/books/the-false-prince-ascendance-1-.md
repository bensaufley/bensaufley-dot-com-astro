Fun. I think this one was ruined a bit by listening to it rather than reading it – the reader wasn't bad, but was very much present in my mind, meaning I couldn't entirely lose myself in the story. It took a weird turn in the middle, not so much plot-wise but storytelling-wise. But it's interesting enough that I may try to pick up the next at some point.<br/><br/>It <em>is</em> one more YA novel where I didn't get a very good feel for the world – the author was too caught up in a few (pretty standard) characters and telling the general plot. I'd like to know more about the world, the way it feels, looks, operates. I think authors can get lost in worldbuilding and that's never good, but YA novels too often forego setting the stage, establishing the setting. This is one of those novels. Maybe now that we've established some characters etc, she'll build out the world a bit more in the next one?
