I was entirely prepared to give this book five stars but she <em>totally</em> lost me with the pitch to give up (??) affirmative action near the end. I never really got the crux of her argument there so it's possible I just entirely misunderstood it, but it felt way off base, especially on the heels of a section about how "color-blind" policies will never solve these problems.<br/><br/>Nah, I'm giving it five stars anyway.<br/><br/>Regardless of that concern this is a very, very important book and I would recommend literally everybody read it. It's even got a little dig at Joe Biden, who currently appears to be preparing to ride Obama's popularity to a Democratic nomination, when in fact he's been a big part of the problem for years and years.<br/><br/>She comes at the issue with a level head and does a very good job addressing a lot of counterarguments and proposed half-measures. In that evenhanded approach, she does have a bit where she concedes that  society has mostly moved past overt racism, which already feels incredibly na√Øve in the era of Trump. But you can see where it came from.<br/><br/>Read this book. Even if you feel like you know, you probably don't know just the extent of the systemic injustice at play in the modern justice system and governmental structure. I thought I knew. I did know some things. But man. Read this.
