Man, I was really interested in reading this book and I did _not_ enjoy it. It reads like a fever dream, and not in any sort of compelling or intriguing way. The heavy, invented colloquial speech is distracting. The plot is not â€¦ really a plot, it's more of a montage of scenes. I found myself moderately interested in the flashbacks to Roland's childhood, because things actually happened there and there was a bit of an understanding of the world he lived in, and there were real secondary characters. Just about everything in the present was hazy and disjointed, void of character or place, and building up to a climax that really wasn't. This is only my second King book (the first was [b:11/22/63|10644930|11/22/63|Stephen King|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327876792s/10644930.jpg|15553789], which I really enjoyed even if I felt the ending got away from him), but my experience with this one was wildly different from the last. I think this book was written much earlier in his career and was maybe more experimental for him?

The good news is that this is one series that I don't find myself compelled to finish. I have too many series to read already.
