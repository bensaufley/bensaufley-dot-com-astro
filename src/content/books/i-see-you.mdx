import Spoiler from '~components/reading/Spoiler.astro';

A well-made thriller. The central element of the thriller, the website, is a kind of fascinating idea that I could totally see someone making in real life (which is not an endorsement—more of a "tech has an ethics problem" thing). The obligatory twists and turns as we find out what was happening were entertaining and not always expected. <Spoiler>The epilogue was a little weird, as it had a major twist that didn't feel epilogue-worthy; but for what it's worth, that twist was one of the few I had guessed.</Spoiler>
