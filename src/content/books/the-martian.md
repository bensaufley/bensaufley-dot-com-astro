It's between 3 and 4 stars. I enjoyed it pretty thoroughly. In the end, it was more of a fun experience than a great book, so I went with three. It's kind of how I felt about the movie Gravity: the actual plot, and anything they tried to do with it, wasn't great. But the way they made you experience it was still really fun. Maybe I'm trying to describe hollow fun? But I don't think this was quite hollow. Just … it leaned toward glib, when its subject matter could've been a lot more thrilling. It favored procedure over storytelling (“here's how I'll construct this tool” rather than any of the potential fear/introspection/character work that could've happened). The glibness made it entertaining – I laughed a lot as I read it – but maybe detracted from the end product.

I don't know, mixed feelings: _I really did enjoy it, start-to-finish, and I'd recommend anyone read it_ . But once it was over it felt a little shallow for what it could have been.
