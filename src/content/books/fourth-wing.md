Someone would argue, and I'd agree, that this book isn't “for” me, so whether or not I appreciate it is irrelevant. But I kind of wonder who it _is_ for. For 70% of the book it's a solidly formulaic YA novel and… then there's explicit sex. And I don't mean like, the characters have sex I mean it becomes an erotica novel, _somewhat_ out of nowhere. Literary porn, although “literary” might give the wrong idea. It's not written _poorly_ but it's also not written very well. Beyond the themes, the writing level of the whole novel feels very YA and the sex feels, to me, unnecessary, somewhat unexpected, and of an equal reading level except with more, you know, obscenity?

I definitely feel like I'm coming off a prude here and I don't feel like I am one, but the sex scenes feel written simply but with adults in mind and I guess that clashed, for me, with the tone and level of the rest of the book.

The main plot is formulaic but interesting enough, but there's not a lot else going on, and the weird horny stuff felt out of place and wasn't for me and I've said that about _plenty_ of books written by men (looking at you Terry Goodkind) so I'm gonna skip the rest of this series.
