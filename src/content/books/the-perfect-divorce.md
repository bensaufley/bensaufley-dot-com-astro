I had kind of forgotten how the first one resolved so it took me a bit to catch up to events. Fun thriller. The twists and turns were fun, kept me guessing, and didn't usually feel cheap once revealed. <x-spoiler>I hope—expect?—there will be a third book that wraps up Sarah's arc. If I'm supposed to be satisfied that she just keeps getting away with it… I'm not. It's not that her adversaries are good, but she's, you know, also not good.</x-spoiler>
