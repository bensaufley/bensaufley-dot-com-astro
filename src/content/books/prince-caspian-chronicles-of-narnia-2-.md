Next to nothing happened in this one. It was almost like a book between adventures except at the end they were like, "our adventure is over! Guess we're going home!"<br/><br/>I want to keep reading this series and probably will because there's so little time commitment but you kind of expect with series like this the world evolves and expands over the course of it; not so here. This one felt less substantial than the first, which already felt a little light. Will the kids ever actually do anything? They're mostly just experiencing everything so far.
