3.5 - 4, but they don't allow half stars. Pretty fun. I feel like it kind of fizzled at the end and honestly, <spoiler>I didn't go much for the whole Sadie saga, which became the focal point as the book went on</spoiler>. But it was still mostly very interesting, moderately smart, and a fun time-travel adventure.
