Lots of interesting stuff in this book. Oddly though the actual title of the book seems to be â€¦ not really the main thrust. The main thrust is all the things that need to be done; how those things are paid for seems to mostly be "it's not actually that important" and I think that's fair but it makes the book title kind of funny.
