In fairness I think I might've liked this book more if I hadn't listened to it on Audible. The narrator's voice wasn't actively bad, but I think it had an impact on my enjoyment – she constantly sounded like she was on the verge of tears, and what should've been an intriguing adventure became just kind of sad and pathetic sounding.

The story itself, I think, was fine. Not particularly special – no shining moments that stood out and stuck with me; characters blended together and the arc of the plot felt kind of level through much of it. But the concept was interesting enough. Some of the mystical bits were kind of intriguing.

It did feel like it ended at the kind of … beginning of the story. Not just in terms of a trilogy or whatever, but like, _this_ arc seemed like it was just starting, regardless of the broader plot.

I probably won't read the next, but that may be more to do with the narrator than the book (if I read it at all, it'd be audio).
