Had some kind of fun ideas but the execution wasn't great. The writing style felt amateur; I felt the author's presence too much, both in the language used and sometimes in the concepts (the spell-shooter may be an interesting twist on paper but its description and use were â€¦ I don't know, not compelling). The pacing and arc of the story were offputting, and the protagonist, more even than many others, was entirely along for the ride, making almost no decisions himself.

It wasn't awful, and I imagine some kids will get a kick out of this series. But I think I've been spoiled by other YA that holds up for adult reading.

It doesn't help that you find yourself forced to compare it to Harry Potter - Ben is Harry, Charlie is Ron; but no Hermione to balance out those two personalities! As the book goes, it distinguishes itself from HP, and really that contrast not a fault of the book itself, but you're going to get those comparisons when you write about an orphaned boy who discovers a secret magical world right under the noses of modern-day England. And when the comparisons come, it's no surprise which series wins.
