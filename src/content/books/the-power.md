In just under the wire, probably my favorite read of the year. The framing at the beginning and end of the novel may be heavy-handed but I love it and it justifies itself with all the stuff in the middle. The characters are engaging, the world Alderman builds is fascinating, and the storyline pays off—it’s not just an interesting idea that fizzles out in the final pages. It never drags. It’s definitely dark in places, but it wasn’t totally depressing. I would highly recommend this book.
