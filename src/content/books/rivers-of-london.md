I would never have read this book if it had been presented in what is apparently the [American branding](https://images.app.goo.gl/wcX6Y55nNzuQmnWV6) which is renamed "Midnight Riot" and features a low-pixel explosion and a silhouetted figure who looks like Vinnie Jones (the protagonist is mixed race and presents as black) and looks just all-around terrible. But I came across the paperback, with the intriguing map illustration and the "Rivers of London" name, and that made me seek out the audiobook (presented as Midnight Riot by Audible US).

It's a fun story, combining elements of American Gods and other magic stories in a detective/crime structure. I'll probably read the next one at some point. So I'm glad I saw the paperback, and not that terrible American cover, first.
