I enjoyed the story and I appreciate Horowitz’s meta approach but just because you’re talking about the tropes you’re engaging in (curmudgeonly male detective who just happens to be brilliant) doesn’t absolve you from engaging in them. And to see this will be a series … meh. I dunno, man. You say “if I were writing it I’d have chosen a different character.” You did write it. Why didn’t you?
