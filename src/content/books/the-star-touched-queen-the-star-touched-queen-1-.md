An interesting book. Definitely a distinct world among much of the YA fantasy I've read, and I appreciated that. I could've done with a bit more character development, and at times a bit more description of where we were, what was … actually happening. The prose got pretty flowery in places—sometimes, it worked, but sometimes it took me out of it. A lot of kind of extravagant descriptions that failed to actually give me a visual picture of a person, place, or thing.<br/><br/>I liked it, but I didn't really finish the book feeling like I wanted to return to the world and characters, because I'd only just started getting to know them when it wrapped up.
