I still really like the world Weeks has built, but I had several issues with this book:

The most glaring is that there was no real overarching plot â€“ it's just a book to, presumably, get you from book three to the final conflict in book five. A lot of stuff happened, but as a book on its own it had no real arc. I don't hate just spending some time in this world, but when it was all over, I was left feeling a bit disappointed.

The other thing that bugged me was the overwhelming horniness of the first two thirds. You'd get a chapter of plot and then a chapter of male desire. I understand that some of this stuff served the plot to a limited extent, but the amount of breasts discussed, and the volume of women throwing themselves at men just became tiresome. It made me think of that meme about "men writing female characters" (Google it). And it was disappointing because much of the rest of the book was really fun and interesting.

The plot has still got me hooked, though, and there's one book left. I'll definitely pick it up when it drops.
