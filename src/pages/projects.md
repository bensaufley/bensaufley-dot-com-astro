# Projects

## Audiobook Catalog

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bensaufley/audiobook-catalog)

A Docker image intended for use with [Unraid](https://www.unraid.net/) providing
a UI for viewing and managing audiobooks. I listen to a lot of audiobooks, from
many sources, and I have a pretty large library, so this was a pet project to
allow me to see them all in one place while at home, and download them directly
to my phone as I wanted. It's a work in progress that will also include things
like "to read"/"read" and genre sorting.

## [Midnight Riders Member Portal](https://members.midnightriders.com)

- **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MidnightRiders/MemberPortal)**

The Midnight Riders are a supporters group for the New England Revolution, and a
501(c)(3)/(7) charitable organization to boot, doing good work in the New
England area for a number of great causes through the year. I've been the Web
Chair for the organization for a few years now, and in the process have built a
Rails application for member sign-up and administration, as well as for a few
interactive features, like Pick ’Em (pick the MLS results for the week), “Rev
Guess” (guess the score of the next Revs game), and Man of the Match voting.
Unfortunately, most of these features are behind a login, but hey – it's only
$20 to become a member!
