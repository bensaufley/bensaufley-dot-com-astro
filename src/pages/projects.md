# Projects

## Audiobook Catalog

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bensaufley/audiobook-catalog)

A Docker image intended for use with [Unraid](https://www.unraid.net/) providing a UI for viewing and managing audiobooks. I listen to a lot of audiobooks, from many sources, and I have a pretty large library, so this was a pet project to allow me to see them all in one place while at home, and download them directly to my phone as I wanted. It's a work in progress that will also include things like "to read"/"read" and genre sorting.

## [Midnight Riders Member Portal](https://members.midnightriders.com)

- **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MidnightRiders/MemberPortal)**

The Midnight Riders are a supporters group for the New England Revolution, and a 501(c)(3)/(7) charitable organization to boot, doing good work in the New England area for a number of great causes through the year. I've been the Web Chair for the organization for a few years now, and in the process have built a Rails application for member sign-up and administration, as well as for a few interactive features, like Pick ’Em (pick the MLS results for the week), “Rev Guess” (guess the score of the next Revs game), and Man of the Match voting. Unfortunately, most of these features are behind a login, but hey – it's only $10 to become a member!

## [Code Words](http://code-words-web.herokuapp.com)

- **[GitHub Repo, Front-End](https://github.com/bensaufley/code-words-web)**
- **[GitHub Repo, API](https://github.com/bensaufley/code-words-api)**

Code Words is an in-development application to play with three other players per game, using react, redux, sequelize, passport, JSON web tokens, and websockets for a live-updated, multi-game experience. More work to come including Facebook authentication (backend built out, front end coming), better styling (currently relying fully on Semantic-React for a Bootstrap-ish feel), and potentially a React-Native implementation for better integration, notifications, etc.

## [Confused: the Webcomic](http://confused.bensaufley.com)

- **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bensaufley/confused-node)**

_Confused_ is a webcomic I started in high school, when I was thinking I wanted to be a video game developer and was trying to make Half Life mods. I imagine most people would delete something like this, especially since I haven't posted a new comic in a little while, but I like having a sort of chronicle of my artistic development from high school through college to recent times.

The GitHub repo is pretty simple – it's a very bare wrapper over a list of images and titles.

## [Your Next Fantasy Book](http://yrnxtfntsybk.herokuapp.com)

- **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bensaufley/yrnxtfntsybk)**

This handy little tool will tell you the name of your next fantasy book (or film, or television show, or video game). Inspired by a combination of browsing Audible for new books and learning about the _Destiny_ expansion, "Rise of Iron."
