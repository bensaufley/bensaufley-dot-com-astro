# Reading

I read a lot, mostly in the form of audiobooks. I have enough audiobooks that I
[built an app to manage the files][audiobook-catalog]. Here's what I'm reading,
what I've read, and what I'm looking to read next.

<div class={styles.hud}>
  <NowReading />
  <UpNext />
</div>

<Read page={0} />
